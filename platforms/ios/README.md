This repository is for a _Godot Engine Plugin_ that allows showing the ads offered by **AdMob** in an **easy** way, without worrying about the building or version, **just download and use**.

The **purpose** of this plugin is to always keep **up to date with Godot**, supporting **ALMOST ALL** versions from v4.1+, and also make the code **compatible** on **[Android](https://github.com/PoingStudios/godot-admob-android) and iOS**, so each advertisement will work **identically on both systems**.

### 🔑 Key features

- It's a wrapper for [Google Mobile Ads SDK](https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/download). 🎁
- Easy Configuration. 😀
- Supports nearly all Ad Formats: **Banner**, **Interstitial**, **Rewarded**, **Rewarded Interstitial**. 📺
- GDPR Compliance with UMP Support. ✉️
- Targeting Capabilities. 🎯
- Seamless integration with Mediation partners: **Meta**, **Vungle**. 💰
- CI/CD for streamlined development and deployment. 🔄🚀
- Features a dedicated [Godot Plugin](https://github.com/PoingStudios/godot-admob-plugin), reducing the need for extensive coding. 🔌
- There is also an [Android Plugin](https://github.com/PoingStudios/godot-admob-android) available, which has the same behavior. 🤖

## 🙋‍♂️How to use 
- We recommend you to use the [AdMob Plugin](https://github.com/PoingStudios/godot-admob-plugin), you can download direcly from [Godot Assets](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2063).
- After download, we recommend you to read the [README.md](https://github.com/PoingStudios/godot-admob-plugin/blob/master/README.md) of the Plugin to know how to use.

## 📦Installing:

### 📥Download
- To get started, download the `poing-godot-admob-ios-v{{ your_godot_version }}.zip` file from the [releases tab](https://github.com/PoingStudios/godot-admob-ios/releases). We recommend checking the [supported Godot version](https://github.com/PoingStudios/godot-admob-versions/blob/master/versions.json) before proceeding. You can also use the [AdMob Plugin](https://github.com/PoingStudios/godot-admob-plugin) for this step by navigating to `Tools -> AdMob Manager -> iOS -> Download & Install`.


### 🧑‍💻Usage
- Video tutorial: https://youtu.be/TB7WhP8mieo
- Inside `poing-godot-admob-ios-v{{ your_godot_version }}.zip` you downloaded, extract everything into the `res://ios/plugins` directory of your Godot project.
- Update the configuration in `res://ios/plugins/poing-godot-admob-ads.gdip`. The `GADApplicationIdentifier` must be changed to your App ID.
- Export the project from Godot, enabling the `Ad Mob` plugin (and any mediation plugins) in the export options.
- **That's it!** The plugin now uses `.xcframework` bundles that are automatically integrated by Godot. No manual Xcode steps or CocoaPods commands are required.
